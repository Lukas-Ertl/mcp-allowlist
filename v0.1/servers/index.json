A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.\n\n### Playwright MCP vs Playwright CLI\n\nThis package provides MCP interface into Playwright. If you are using a **coding agent**, you might benefit from using the [CLI+SKILLS](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) instead.\n\n- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.<br>**Learn more about [Playwright CLI with SKILLS](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli)**.\n\n- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.\n- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.\n- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.\n\n### Requirements\n- Node.js 18 or newer\n- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Goose or any other MCP client\n\n<!--\n// Generate using:\nnode utils/generate-links.js\n-->\n\n### Getting started\n\nFirst, install the Playwright MCP server with your client.\n\n**Standard config** works in most of the tools:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF\" alt=\"Install in VS Code\">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522playwright%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522%2540playwright%252Fmcp%2540latest%2522%255D%257D) [<img alt=\"Install in VS Code Insiders\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5\">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522playwright%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522%2540playwright%252Fmcp%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Amp</summary>\n\nAdd via the Amp VS Code extension settings screen or by updating your settings.json file:\n\n```json\n\"amp.mcpServers\": {\n  \"playwright\": {\n    \"command\": \"npx\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Amp CLI Setup:**\n\nAdd via the `amp mcp add`command below\n\n```bash\namp mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Claude Code</summary>\n\nUse the Claude Code CLI to add the Playwright MCP server:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Claude Desktop</summary>\n\nFollow the MCP install [guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user), use the standard config above.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cline</summary>\n\nFollow the instruction in the section [Configuring MCP Servers](https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers)\n\n**Example: Local Setup**\n\nAdd the following to your [`cline_mcp_settings.json`](https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers#editing-mcp-settings-files) file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"timeout\": 30,\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n      ],\n      \"disabled\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Codex</summary>\n\nUse the Codex CLI to add the Playwright MCP server:\n\n```bash\ncodex mcp add playwright npx \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, create or edit the configuration file `~/.codex/config.toml` and add:\n\n```toml\n[mcp_servers.playwright]\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [Codex MCP documentation](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Copilot</summary>\n\nUse the Copilot CLI to interactively add the Playwright MCP server:\n\n```bash\n/mcp add\n```\n\nAlternatively, create or edit the configuration file `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"type\": \"local\",\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"tools\": [\n        \"*\"\n      ],\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [Copilot CLI documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cursor</summary>\n\n#### Click the button to install:\n\n[<img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Install in Cursor\">](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=Playwright&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IEBwbGF5d3JpZ2h0L21jcEBsYXRlc3QifQ%3D%3D)\n\n#### Or install manually:\n\nGo to `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new MCP Server`.

Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,\nthe session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state\nto the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage\nstate [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).\n\n```js\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\",\n        \"--isolated\",\n        \"--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Browser Extension**\n\nThe Playwright MCP Chrome Extension allows you to connect to existing browser tabs and leverage your logged-in sessions and browser state. See [packages/extension/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/main/packages/extension/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.\n\n### Initial state\n\nThere are multiple ways to provide the initial state to the browser context or a page.\n\nFor the storage state, you can either:\n- Start with a user data directory using the `--user-data-dir` argument. This will persist all browser data between the sessions.\n- Start with a storage state file using the `--storage-state` argument. This will load cookies and local storage from the file into an isolated browser context.\n\nFor the page state, you can use:\n\n- `--init-page` to point to a TypeScript file that will be evaluated on the Playwright page object. This allows you to run arbitrary code to set up the page.\n\n```ts\n// init-page.ts\nexport default async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);\n  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });\n  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 720 });\n};\n```\n\n- `--init-script` to point to a JavaScript file that will be added as an initialization script. The script will be evaluated in every page before any of the page's scripts.\nThis is useful for overriding browser APIs or setting up the environment.\n\n```js\n// init-script.js\nwindow.isPlaywrightMCP = true;\n```\n\n### Configuration file\n\nThe Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file\nusing the `--config` command line option:\n\n```bash\nnpx @playwright/mcp@latest --config path/to/config.json\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Configuration file schema</summary>\n\n<!--- Config generated by update-readme.js -->\n\n```typescript\n{\n  /**\n   * The browser to use.\n   */\n  browser?: {\n    /**\n     * The type of browser to use.\n     */\n    browserName?: 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit';\n\n    /**\n     * Keep the browser profile in memory, do not save it to disk.\n     */\n    isolated?: boolean;\n\n    /**\n     * Path to a user data directory for browser profile persistence.\n     * Temporary directory is created by default.\n     */\n    userDataDir?: string;\n\n    /**\n     * Launch options passed to\n     * @see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context\n     *\n     * This is useful for settings options like `channel`, `headless`, `executablePath`, etc.\n     */\n    launchOptions?: playwright.LaunchOptions;\n\n    /**\n     * Context options for the browser context.\n     *\n     * This is useful for settings options like `viewport`.\n     */\n    contextOptions?: playwright.BrowserContextOptions;\n\n    /**\n     * Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint to connect to an existing browser instance in case of Chromium family browsers.\n     */\n    cdpEndpoint?: string;\n\n    /**\n     * CDP headers to send with the connect request.\n     */\n    cdpHeaders?: Record<string, string>;\n\n    /**\n     * Timeout in milliseconds for connecting to CDP endpoint.
